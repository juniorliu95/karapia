This work was based on Pianoputer(https://github.com/Zulko/pianoputer) and mediapipe(https://github.com/google/mediapipe).

run it just by: `python run.py`
Then hit the keys while looking at the screen.

This work is very unstable now, and therefore many mistaken detections will happen. But anyway, it's fun!
